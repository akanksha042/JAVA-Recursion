# Recursion in Java

This repository contains a collection of standard recursion problems implemented in Java. It is designed to help you understand and practice recursion by solving problems ranging from basic to advanced difficulty levels.

## Problem Set

The repository includes the following recursion problems:

1. **Factorial**: Calculate the factorial of a given number.
2. **Fibonacci**: Generate the nth Fibonacci number.
3. **Sum of Digits**: Compute the sum of digits of a given number.
4. **Power**: Calculate the power of a number.
5. **Greatest Common Divisor**: Find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
6. **Tiling Problem**: Calculate the number of ways to tile a given area using 1x2 tiles.
7. **Power of N**: Calculate the power of a number raised to the nth power.
8. **First Occurrence of Element**: Find the index of the first occurrence of a given element in an array.
9. **Remove Duplicates**: Remove duplicates from an array.
10. **Permutations**: Generate all permutations of a given string.

Each problem is implemented in Java and includes a detailed explanation and the corresponding recursive solution.
